	Simple (for now) tool of auto-freeing allocated areas.

	The tool is initialized before 'main()' function call. It loads every
'addr'-'destroyer' pair into its internal structure. After 'main()' returns,
the tool calls 'destroyer(addr)' for each pair.

	It is made to be compatible with 42schools projects, the only external
functions needed are:
 - malloc();
 - free();
 - write();
 - memcpy();
 - memset();
So, they can easily be implemented for projects.

'addr' can refer to any type of data, as long as 'destroyer' is a function,
which can take 'addr' as the only parameter and successfully de-allocate it.
You may find the example.c file quite elucidative.
